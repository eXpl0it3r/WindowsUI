# Windows UI

Over the past nearly 40 years, Microsoft has released different UI frameworks for "native" app development. While the earliest APIs have been C and C++ focussed, later editions saw architectural designs from the .NET world and others being extensions of COM.

This repository tries to collect minimal examples for each UI framework / API and in doing so, tries to prioritize building through CMake rather than classic Visual Studio projects, whenever possible.
